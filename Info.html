           An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and/or freight.
           Airlines use aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines
           for codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and operate the same flight.
           Generally, airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a governmental aviation body.
